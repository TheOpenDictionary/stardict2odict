==============

This tiny utility converts StarDict dictionaries to ODict XML (ODXML), which can then be compiled to a binary ODict dictionary using [the ODict compiler](https://github.com/odict/odict). 

The StarDict file format is rather convoluted and requires *multiple*, that's right, ***multiple*** files in order to run. It's also pretty poorly documented. The only documentation you'll find about it is scattered across the internet, but [here](https://code.google.com/p/babiloo/wiki/StarDict_format) is a pretty good explanation linked to from the [repo this code was based on](https://github.com/wyage/star-dict-parser) (pfff like we'd really write a StarDict parser ourselves... *please*). 

We'll add more info about the API eventually, so you can, you know, actually use this library.
